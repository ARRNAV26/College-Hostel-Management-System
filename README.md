# College-Hostel-Management-System
A DBMS mini-project using HTML3, CSS5 and Bootstrap.js for the frontend dev, Node.js for backend dev and MYSQL for database storage. 


This project on College student information management system is one complete
information management solution for students and staff of any educational institution. In
today's world, it is a need to organize huge amount of data than ever before. In the absence
of a great infrastructure for faculties, students and departments, management to exchange
data, crucial information about students and organizations can be misplaced, which can
cause loads of problems that can affect the reputation of the organization. For an academic
institution, the data handling should be an easy task for which online approach is a must.


I hope you analyze my project properly and give me recommendations to improve my work and encourage learning. Thank You!
